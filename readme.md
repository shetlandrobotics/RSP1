# Intelligent Sinker Probe

Welcome to the Intelligent Sinker Probe project! This repository will soon contain the open-source software and design documents for our innovative AI-powered underwater probe. The Intelligent Sinker Probe is designed to streamline underwater data collection, offering an affordable solution for large-scale monitoring of marine environments.

## Project Status

**Note:** This project is currently in development. We are in the process of manufacturing the prototype version and will soon publish the design documents, parts included documents, and software source code. Stay tuned for updates!

## Overview

The Intelligent Sinker Probe is a modular, component-based system that can be launched from a vessel. It descends to the seabed, collecting water samples at various depths, and upon reaching the bottom, it takes sediment samples and performs visual inspections using high-resolution cameras. The probe is equipped with LED floodlights and is powered by AI, capable of running a variety of intelligent models.

## Features

- **AI Processor**: A powerful microcomputer with an industrial-grade AI processor for implementing AI analysis into monitoring systems.
- **High-Resolution Cameras**: Two 12 MegaPixel cameras (wide-angle and telephoto) for detailed imaging and analysis.
- **LED Floodlights**: Essential lighting for deep-sea exploration.
- **Flotation Device**: Ensures easy retrieval after surfacing.
- **Water Sampler**: Collects water samples at pre-configured depths.
- **Sediment Sampler**: Collects sediment samples upon impact with the seabed.

## Modular Design

The probe's modular design allows for customization and extension to perform new tasks. We are making the software and design documents open source, enabling anyone to manufacture the probe free of charge. Additional services, such as creating specific AI models and automation, are available but may not be open source to protect customer-specific tasks.

## Use Cases

- **Blue Carbon Initiatives**: Investigate the ocean's capacity to act as a carbon sink by collecting water and sediment samples for CO2 analysis.
- **Oceanic Contamination and Environmental Monitoring**: Monitor pollutants, nutrient levels, and chemical parameters in marine ecosystems.

## Deployment

The Intelligent Sinker Probe can be easily deployed by hand from a vessel, eliminating the need for expensive research ships or complicated machinery. It surfaces for easy retrieval after completing its tasks.

## MV Jorgen Amundsen

Our research ship, the MV Jorgen Amundsen, is an optimized platform for initiating monitoring projects. We can deploy multiple probes simultaneously and offer both on-site and remote operations, collaborating with local vessels and partners.
